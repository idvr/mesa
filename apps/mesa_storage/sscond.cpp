/* APP_Message
**
** Purpose:
**	This function accepts a CONDITION as an input parameter and finds
**	the ASCIZ message that is defined for that CONDITION.  If the
**	CONDITION is defined for this facility, this function returns
**	a pointer to the ASCIZ string which describes the condition.
**	If the CONDITION is not found, the function returns NULL.
**
** Parameter Dictionary:
**	condition	The CONDITION used to search the dictionary.
**
** Return Values:
**	ASCIZ string which describes the condtion requested by the caller
**	NULL if the condition is not found
